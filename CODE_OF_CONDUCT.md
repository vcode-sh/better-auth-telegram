# Code of Conduct

## The Pledge

Look, you're here because you like building things and arguing about TypeScript. This project is a place where everyone should be able to do that without being harassed, regardless of who they are, what they look like, where they're from, or whether they prefer tabs or spaces.

I pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone -- no exceptions, no asterisks, no "well actually."

## What I'm Into

- Being decent to each other (the bar is low, and yet)
- Respecting that other people have different perspectives and experiences
- Taking constructive criticism without treating it like a personal attack
- Focusing on what makes the project better, not on winning arguments
- Showing basic human empathy (yes, even on the internet)

## What Will Get You Shown the Door

To be clear, because apparently this needs to be spelled out every time:

- Sexualized language, imagery, or unwanted advances -- this is a code repo, not a dating app
- Trolling, insults, derogatory comments, personal or political attacks -- save it for X (Twitter)
- Harassment of any kind, public or private -- zero tolerance, full stop
- Publishing someone's private information without their permission -- that's called doxxing and it's never okay
- Any conduct that a reasonable person would consider inappropriate -- if you have to ask, don't do it

I'm perfectly happy being snarky about code, build tools, and the state of the JavaScript ecosystem. I'm not happy with snark directed at people's identities or existence. There is a difference. You know the difference.

## Enforcement

If someone is making this space hostile, report it to **hello@vcode.sh**. All reports are reviewed promptly and taken seriously.

Consequences scale with severity: a warning, a temporary ban, or a permanent ban. I'd rather not enforce any of this. Don't make me.

## Attribution

Adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1. I added personality. They provided the legal backbone.
